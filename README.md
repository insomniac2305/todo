## Overview

A ToDo list is the classic first application to build when getting started with software development. This one features an interactive UI that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks separated into projects, with all data persistently stored in local storage.

Originally built as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to practice developing an interactive web app with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it was later converted to TypeScript for learning purposes.
